Hello friends, after posting the last blog post I got 3 emails about my blog. They were mainly about my other stuff that I am posting on my blog. They recommend me to focus on 1 topic and post about that topic. The one that I love to work for my future life, Bioinformatics. So I did not remove the old content but I did put them in ```_oldposts``` folder. If you go to my blog page on [Github](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/eneskemalergin.github.io) you can find the folder and see the old posts again.

I'm so excited becuase this is the beginning of a long journey...
