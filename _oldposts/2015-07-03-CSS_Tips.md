The most common method of associating styles with your document is to use a link element within the head of a document. The source of link elements usually looks something like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" media="screen" title="Primary Stylesheet" />
```
This approach also supports stylesheet choices: a stylist can create multiple stylesheets, assign a ```title``` to each, and assign a second rel (relation) value of ```alternate``` to all but one of the referenced stylesheets. (Multiple rel values should be separated by spaces.)

Users will then be able to choose which stylesheet they want to associate with your site. This feature is supported by Firefox, recent versions of Safari, and Internet Explorer 8.
