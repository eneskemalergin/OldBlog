## Paragraphs (Detailed)
The HTML ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph. HTML documents are divided into paragraphs.

> Browsers automatically add an empty line before and after a paragraph.

The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed. Any number of spaces, and any number of new lines, count as only one space.

```html
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>
//or
<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser
ignores it.
</p>
```

> Most browsers will display HTML correctly even if you forget the end tag:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is another paragraph
```
The example above will work in most browsers, but do not rely on it. Forgetting the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.

### Line Breaks
The HTML ```<br>``` element defines a line break. Use ```<br>``` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

```html
 <p>This is<br>a para<br>graph with line breaks</p>
```
The ```<br>``` element is an empty HTML element. It has no end tag.

### HTML ```<pre>``` Element
The HTML ```<pre>``` element defines preformatted text. The text inside a ```<pre>``` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

```html
<pre>
 My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

 My Bonnie lies over the sea.

 My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

 Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
```

## Styles
Every HTML element has a default style (background color is white and text color is black). Changing the default style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute. This example changes the default background color from white to light grey:

```html
<body style="background-color:lightgrey">

  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
```

 > The bgcolor attribute, supported in older versions of HTML, is not valid in HTML5.

### Style Attribute
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

```html
style="property:value"
```
#### Text Color
The color property defines the text color to be used for an HTML element:

```html
<h1 style="color:blue">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red">This is a paragraph.</p>
```
#### Fonts
The font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

```html
<h1 style="font-family:verdana">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier">This is a paragraph.</p>
```
> The <font> tag, supported in older versions of HTML, is not valid in HTML5.

#### Text Size
The font-size property defines the text size to be used for an HTML element:

```html
<h1 style="font-size:300%">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

#### Text Alignment
The text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

```html
<h1 style="text-align:center">Centered Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
>  The ```<center>``` tag, supported in older versions of HTML, is not valid in HTML5.

## Text Formatting Elements
HTML also defines special elements, for defining text with a special meaning. HTML uses elements like ```<b>``` and ```<i>``` for formatting output, like bold or italic text.

### <b>Bold</b> and <strong>Strong</strong> Formatting
The HTML ```<b>``` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

```html
<p>This text is normal.</p>

<p><b>This text is bold</b>.</p>
```

The HTML ```<strong>``` element defines strong text, with added semantic "strong" importance.

```html
<p>This text is normal.</p>

<p><strong>This text is strong</strong>.</p>
```

### <i>Italic</i> and <em>Emphasized</em> Formatting
The HTML ```<i>``` element defines italic text, without any extra importance.

```html
<p>This text is normal.</p>

<p><i>This text is italic</i>.</p>
```

The HTML ```<em>``` element defines emphasized text, with added semantic importance.

```html
<p>This text is normal.</p>

<p><em>This text is emphasized</em>.</p>
```
> Browsers display ```<strong>``` as ```<b>```, and ```<em>``` as ```<i>```. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: ```<b>``` and ```<i>``` defines bold and italic text, but ```<strong>``` and ```<em>``` means that the text is "important".


### <small>small</small> Formatting
The HTML ```<small>``` element defines small text:

```html
 <h2>HTML <small>Small</small> Formatting</h2>
 ```

### <mark>Marked</mark> Formatting
The HTML ```<mark>``` element defines marked or highlighted text:

```html
<h2>HTML <mark>Marked</mark> Formatting</h2>
```

### <del>Deleted</del> Formatting
The HTML ```<del>``` element defines deleted (removed) of text.

```html
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
```

### <ins>Inserted</ins> Formatting
The HTML ```<ins>``` element defines inserted (added) text.

```html
 <p>My favorite <ins>color</ins> is red.</p>
```

### <sub>Subscript</sub> Formatting
The HTML ```<sub>``` element defines subscripted text.

```html
 <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
```

### <sup>Superscript</sup> Formatting
The HTML ```<sup>``` element defines superscripted text.

```html
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
```
