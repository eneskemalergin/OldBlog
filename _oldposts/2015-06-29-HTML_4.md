## Quotation and Citation Elements
### ```<q>``` for Short Quotations
The HTML ```<q>``` element defines a short quotation. Browsers usually insert quotation marks around the ```<q>``` element.

```html
 <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
```

### ```<blockquote>``` for Long Quotations
The HTML ```<blockquote>``` element defines a quoted section. Browsers usually indent ```<blockquote>``` elements.

```html
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>
```

### ```<address>``` for Contact Information
The HTML ```<address>``` element defines contact information (author/owner) of a document or article.The ```<address>``` element is usually displayed in italic. Most browsers will add a line break before and after the element.

```html
<address>
Written by Jon Doe.<br>
Visit us at:<br>
Example.com<br>
Box 564, Disneyland<br>
USA
</address>
```

### ```<cite>``` for for Work title
The HTML ```<cite>``` element defines the title of a work. Browsers usually display ```<cite>``` elements in italic.

```html
 <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
```

### ```<bdo>``` for Bi-Directional Override
The HTML ```<bdo>``` element defines bi-directional override. The ```<bdo>``` element is used to override the current text direction:

```html
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>
```

## Computer Code Elements
Computer Codes maybe directly used in html directly. Usually javascript.Here is a object called person.

```js
var person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyeColor:"blue"
}
```
Normally, HTML uses variable letter size, and variable letter spacing. This is not wanted when displaying examples of computer code. The ```<kbd>```, ```<samp>```, and ```<code>``` elements all support fixed letter size and spacing.

### Keyboard Formatting
The HTML ```<kbd>``` element defines keyboard input:

```html
<p>To open a file, select:</p>

<p><kbd>File | Open...</kbd></p>
```

### Sample Formatting
The HTML ```<samp>``` element defines a computer output:

```html
<samp>
demo.example.com login: Apr 12 09:10:17
Linux 2.6.10-grsec+gg3+e+fhs6b+nfs+gr0501+++p3+c4a+gr2b-reslog-v6.189
</samp>
```

### Code Formatting
The HTML ```<code>``` element defines programming code:

```html
<code>
var person = { firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue" }
</code>
```

The ```<code>``` element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks:

```html
<p>Coding Example:</p>

<code>
var person = {
   firstName:"John",
   lastName:"Doe",
   age:50,
   eyeColor:"blue"
}
</code>
```

To fix this, you must wrap the code in a ```<pre>``` element:

```html
<p>Coding Example:</p>

<code>
<pre>
var person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyeColor:"blue"
}
</pre>
</code>
```

### Variable Formatting
The HTML ```<var>``` element defines a mathematical variable:

```html
<p>Einstein wrote:</p>

<p><var>E = m c<sup>2</sup></var></p>
```


## Comments
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

```html
<!-- Write your comments here -->
```

> There is an exclamation point (!) in the opening tag, but not in the closing tag.

Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML. With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
```
