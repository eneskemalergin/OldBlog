 - HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).

 Here is a simple html page.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
<body>

  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
## The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration helps the browser to display a web page correctly. To display a document correctly, the browser must know both type and version. The doctype declaration is not case sensitive. All cases are acceptable.

  - HTML5:  ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
  - HTML 4.01:  ```<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "link and explanation" >```
  - XHTML 1.0:  ```<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "link and explanation" >```

## Basics
All HTML documents must start with a type declaration: ```<!DOCTYPE html>.``` The HTML document itself begins with ```<html>``` and ends with ```</html>```. The visible part of the HTML document is between ```<body>``` and ```</body>```.

### Headings
HTML headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<h2>This is a heading</h2>
<h3>This is a heading</h3>
```
### Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the ```<p>``` tag:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

### Links
HTML links are defined with the ```<a>``` tag:

```html
 <a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
```
The link address is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

### Images
HTML images are defined with the ```<img>``` tag. The source file (src), alternative text (alt), and size (width and height) are provided as attributes:

```html
 <img src="sample.jpg" alt="sample image" width="104" height="142">
 ```
## Elements

HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:

```html
 <p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>
```
 >  	However, Some HTML elements do not have an end tag.

 - The ```<html>``` element defines the whole document.
 - It has a start tag ```<html>``` and an end tag ```</html>```.
 - The element content is another HTML element (the <body> element).

```html
<html>
  <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```

 - The ```<body>``` element defines the document body.
 - It has a start tag ```<body>``` and an end tag ```</body>```.
 - The element content is two other HTML elements (```<h1>``` and ```<p>```).

 ```html
<body>

  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
```

 - The ```<h1>``` element defines a heading.
 - It has a start tag ```<h1>``` and an end tag ```</h1>```.
 - The element content is: My First Heading.

```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
```

 - The ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph.
 - It has a start tag ```<p>``` and an end tag ```</p>```.
 - The element content is: My first paragraph.

> There are some elements are empty.

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. ```<br>``` is an empty element without a closing tag (the ```<br>``` tag defines a line break). Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: ```<br />```.

> HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you should close all HTML elements.

> HTML tags are not case sensitive: ```<P>``` means the same as ```<p>```.
