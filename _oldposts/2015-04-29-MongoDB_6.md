## Screen Scraping

Data is not always available for us to download directly, sometimes we need to get it from web. From one or multiple sources. In some cases we need to get the data from scraping web and filtering it out ourselfs manually. We might need this method in most goverment data and small companies data.

What is the procedure when we get the data by scraping the web? If we want to get data from a web site which you can filter the result by some down menu options then answer follows the steps following:

- Choose the filters and options that you want to get extract from the whole data.
- Make http request to download all the data
- Then Parse the data files

How to get the data from web source we may use beautifulsoup4 library to get the data from web. For this you need to manually save the source as .html and write ```soup = BeatifulSoup(open(name.html)) ``` But make sure that you have already imported the library. ( ```from bs4 import BeatifulSoup``` ) We need to get the form tag's data, because they filtering with choose from form tag.

Then we need to examine and find out the post request from the web, we might use inspect elements option in the web browser.
