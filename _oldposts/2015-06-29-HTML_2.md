## Attributes
 - HTML elements can have attributes
 - Attributes provide additional information about an element
 - Attributes are always specified in the start tag
 - Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

### lang Attribute
The document language can be declared in the ```<html>``` tag. The language is declared in the lang attribute. Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

  </body>
</html>
```
> The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).

### title Attribute
HTML paragraphs are defined with the ```<p>``` tag. In next example, the ```<p>``` element has a title attribute.

```html
<p title="About this attribute">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
</p>
```

> When you move the mouse over the element, the title will be displayed as a tooltip.

### href Attribute
HTML links are defined with the ```<a>```tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:

```html
 <a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
 ```

### size Attributes
HTML images are defined with the ```<img>``` tag. The filename of the source (src), and the size of the image (width and height) are all provided as attributes:

```html
 <img src="sample.jpg" width="104" height="142">
```

> The image size is specified in pixels: width="104" means 104 screen pixels wide.

### alt Attribute
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an HTML element cannot be displayed. The value of the attribute can be read by "screen readers". This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, i.e. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

```html
 <img src="sample.jpg" alt="this is a sample image" width="104" height="142">
 ```

### Best Way of Coding HTML

 1. The HTML5 standard does not require lower case attribute names. The title attribute can be written with upper or lower case like Title and/or TITLE. W3C recommends lowercase in HTML4, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

> Lower case is the most common. Lower case is easier to type.

 2. The HTML5 standard does not require quotes around attribute values.The href attribute, demonstrated above, can be written as:

```html
 <a href=http://www.google.com>
```

Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes. This will not display correctly, because it contains a space:

```html
 <p title=About Sample>
```

> sing quotes are the most common. Omitting quotes can produce errors.


 3. Double style quotes are the most common in HTML, but single style can also be used. In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

```html
<p title='Enes Kemal"s Notes'>
// or
<p title="Enes Kemal's Notes">
 ```

## Headings (Detailed)
Headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags. ```<h1>``` defines the most important heading/biggest heading. ```<h6>``` defines the least important heading/smallest heading.

Search engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure. h1 headings should be main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

### Horizontal Rulers
The ```<hr>``` tag creates a horizontal line in an HTML page. The hr element can be used to separate content:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
### ```<head>``` Element
The HTML ```<head>``` element has nothing to do with HTML headings. The HTML ```<head>``` element contains meta data. Meta data are not displayed. The HTML ```<head>``` element is placed between the ```<html>``` tag and the ```<body>``` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Title of a Website</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

<body>
```

> Meta data means data about data. HTML meta data is data about the HTML document.

### ```<title>``` Element
The HTML ```<title>``` element is meta data. It defines the HTML document's title. The title will not be displayed in the document, but might be displayed in the browser tab.

### ```<meta>``` Element
The HTML ```<meta>``` element is also meta data. It can be used to define the character set, and other information about the HTML document.
